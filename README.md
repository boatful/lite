# lite
core IDE
This sub-folder of the hta17 repo contains 9 or so files that are the core of my project development.
They only work on a local machine if the full hta17 project is downloaded/unzipped first.
Once that has been done, a "lite" download can be performed, on as as-needed basis.
The latest/greatest files in "lite", zipped and downloaded, will need to be 
unzipped into the /lite subdirectory of the full project on your local machine.

At UVMMC, they work best if run from the S: drive, not your personal M: drive.
